The aim of the project is provide recommendations for pricing strategies to maximize revenue while maintaining competitiveness.

Optional: Evaluate the ROI of various promotional strategies (e.g., "Buy One Get One Free," 10% discounts).

Since I cannot access historical sales data, I will simulate my own dataset using python.

Patterns are stimulated following below conditions:
- Higher sales during promotions.
- Decreased sales when prices rise above certain thresholds.

Analyze how changes in price affect sales volume.
Calculate price elasticity coefficients and identify optimal pricing strategies.
Deliver insights on pricing thresholds (e.g., identifying prices beyond which sales drop significantly).
